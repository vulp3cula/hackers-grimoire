# Antivirus evasion
It seems like antivirus evasion tutorials go out of date pretty fast. I was going to write some notes about encoding msfvenom payloads with `shikata na gai` and encrypting payloads with Hyperion, but then I tested both on my desktop and they were blown up instantly by enterprise AV. So I'm going to do some more research with [Veil](https://www.veil-framework.com/) and [Empire](https://www.powershellempire.com/). If they do better, I'll write about them here.
